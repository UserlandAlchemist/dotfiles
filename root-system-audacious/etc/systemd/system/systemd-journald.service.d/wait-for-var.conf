# Wait for /var mount before starting journald
#
# Required because /var is on separate ZFS dataset (rpool/VAR).
# Without this, journald starts before /var is ready and silently
# fails to create system journal in /var/log/journal/, resulting in
# zero system-level log capture until journald is manually restarted.
#
# IMPORTANT: This file must be installed as a real file (not symlink) in /etc
# so systemd can read it at early boot. Use install.sh.
