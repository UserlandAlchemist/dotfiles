# Enable debug logging for journald startup diagnostics
#
# This helps diagnose why journald fails to create system journal at boot
# but succeeds when manually restarted.
#
# IMPORTANT: This file must be installed as a real file (not symlink) in /etc
# so systemd can read it at early boot. Use install.sh.
